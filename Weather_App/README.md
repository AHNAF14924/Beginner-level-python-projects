# Weather App

This is a simple Python program that retrieves weather information for a given city using the OpenWeatherMap API and displays it on the command line.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- requests library

## Installation

Install the required requests library using pip.

`pip install requests`

## API Key

To use the OpenWeatherMap API, you need an API key. If you don't have one, you can sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and obtain an API key.

Once you have your API key, replace the `key` variable in the `get_weather_data()` function with your own API key.
